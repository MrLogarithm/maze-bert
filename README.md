# Maze

This directory contains code for auto-generating Maze task distractors and running Maze tasks online using Ibex. It also contains the materials, data, and analysis code associated with the paper *Maze Made Easy* ([Preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/b7nqd/)).

The auto-generation of materials and Ibex framework are designed to work together, but can be used independently.
 - maze_automate contains code and instructions for auto-generating Maze materials 
 - experiment contains materials, data, analysis for *Maze Made Easy* 

Files and instructions for running maze using Ibex are now in [its own repo](https://github.com/vboyce/Ibex-with-Maze)

See also <vboyce.github.io/Maze> for more information on automating the Maze task and running it on Ibex.
