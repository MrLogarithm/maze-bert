# Maze

This directory contains code for auto-generating Maze task distractors and running Maze tasks online using Ibex. It also contains the materials, data, and analysis code associated with the paper *Maze Made Easy* ([Preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/b7nqd/)).

The auto-generation of materials and Ibex framework are designed to work together, but can be used independently.
 - ibex_maze contains files and instructions for running maze using Ibex (now in [its own repo](https://github.com/vboyce/Ibex-with-Maze) instead) 
 - maze_automate contains code and instructions for auto-generating Maze materials 
 - experiment contains materials, data, analysis for *Maze Made Easy* 
 - French_auto_maze contains code for auto-generating Maze materials in French (this has not been tested)
