# A-maze 

A-maze is an incremental sentence processing method; it's a variant of the Maze task that uses automatically generated distractors. 

On other pages of this site, you can learn [more about the Maze task](intro.md), learn [how to set-up](install.md) and [start using A-maze](usage_basic.md) in your own research, and learn about [running Maze experiments online](ibex.md).
